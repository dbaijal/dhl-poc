              <p>The company wanted to minimize frustration and&nbsp;unproductive IT downtime, especially for mission-&nbsp;critical and customer-facing employees, in order to&nbsp;retain staff, maintain business continuity, and&nbsp;efficiently serve its customers.&nbsp;In 2020, the start of the Covid-19 pandemic&nbsp;accelerated the trend of working from home and the&nbsp;company pivoted swiftly to allow employees to do&nbsp;this. However, post-pandemic analysis indicated 40%&nbsp;of the global workforce of around 56,000 employees&nbsp;would continue to work remotely, so a detailed plan&nbsp;was needed.<br>Not only must the company cost-effectively deliver&nbsp;laptops, mobiles, tablets, and associated hardware to&nbsp;tens of thousands of addresses around the globe&nbsp;instead of a few hundred corporate locations, it must&nbsp;also deliver an excellent digital experience to every&nbsp;member of its dispersed workforce.&nbsp;DHL had clearly demonstrated its end-to-end IT&nbsp;equipment delivery capabilities, serving the company’s internal teams in France, Germany, and&nbsp;the Nordics for several years. In addition, DHL offered&nbsp;the necessary global supply chain infrastructure. The&nbsp;companies therefore collaborated to customize a&nbsp;‘work from anywhere’ solution.</p>
              <h6 id="dhl-supply-chain-solution">DHL SUPPLY CHAIN SOLUTION</h6>
              <p>This fully integrated global end-to-end solution&nbsp;encompasses all stages of deploying, refreshing and&nbsp;returning IT equipment and is designed around the&nbsp;user experience. When an employee’s PC breaks&nbsp;down or when a manager wants to deploy new&nbsp;equipment, they access a user-friendly online portal.&nbsp;Placing an order before midday means the&nbsp;replacement or new PC and other items arrive the&nbsp;very next morning* – pre-installed and pre-configured as before.&nbsp;For any equipment that’s switched out, DHL provides&nbsp;a turnkey circular supply chain solution. DHL&nbsp;performs technical checks and, if necessary, passes&nbsp;the old device to a repair provider. Refreshed&nbsp;equipment is then made available to other employees&nbsp;or sold on, with all data safely wiped. If the device&nbsp;can’t be reused, end-of-life hardware management&nbsp;ensures its components are recycled.&nbsp;Inventory visibility and control are provided by DHL&nbsp;SeLECT, a single-source global IT platform that is<br>modular, scalable, and resilient. The IT department is&nbsp;able to track the location and status of all assets&nbsp;while maintaining highest levels of data security. This&nbsp;reduces business risk and ensures the department&nbsp;remains agile and responsive to the employees it&nbsp;serves.</p>
